## About

**Needle** is my first ever coding project. Itâ€™s a simple, customizable command-line shell designed to execute a handful of essential system commands. **Needle** is specifically built for Arch Linux, offering a streamlined way to interact with your system using commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `pacman`, `mkdir`, and `cd`.

**Commands:**
- `help`: Display command list.
- `ls`: List directory contents.
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `pacman`: Manage packages using the Arch Linux package manager.
- `mkdir`: Create new directories.
- `cd`: Change the current directory.
- `exit`: Exit the **Needle** shell.
- `cat`: Read or write to folders.
- `randomnum`: Random number generator.
- `checksum`: Generate a checksum
  
*Note: This shell is intended for use on Arch Linux systems only.*

## Installation

To get **Needle** up and running on your Arch Linux system, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install Ruby**: Ensure Ruby is installed on your system. Ruby is the programming language **Needle** is written in. If Ruby is not already installed, you can download it from the official Ruby website [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

2. **Download Needle**: [Download](https://github.com/DayreaverDoesThings/Needle-Shell/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the **Needle Shell** zip file. This zip file contains all the necessary files to run Needle.

3. **Extract the Zip File**: Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the zip file to a directory of your choice. This will be the directory where you will run **Needle**.

4. **Run the Install Script**:
    - Open your terminal application.
    - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you extracted **Needle**.
    - Use to `cd` command to go to the scripts/ directory.
    - Run the installation script by executing:
      ```bash
      ./install.sh
      ```

    - After this, you will see the **Needle** prompt, and you can start entering commands.

**Needle** is open source and highly customizable. Feel free to modify the code, add new commands, or make any changes to suit your needs!
