## About

**Needle** is my first ever coding project. It’s a simple, customizable command-line shell designed to execute a handful of essential system commands. Needle is specifically built for Arch Linux, offering a streamlined way to interact with your system using commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `pacman`, `mkdir`, and `cd`

**Commands:**
- `ls`: List directory contents.
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `pacman`: Manage packages using the Arch Linux package manager.
- `mkdir`: Create new directories.
- `cd`: Change the current directory.
- `exit`: Exit the Needle shell.

*Note: This shell is intended for use on Arch Linux systems only.*

## Installation

To get **Needle** up and running on your Arch Linux system, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install Ruby**: Ensure Ruby is installed on your system. Ruby is the programming language Needle is written in. If Ruby is not already installed, you can download it from the official Ruby website [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

2. **Download Needle**: Head over to the [Needle GitHub repository](https://github.com/DayreaverDoesThings/Needle-Shell/tree/main) and download the Needle Shell zip file. This contains all the necessary files to run Needle.

3. **Extract the Zip File**: Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the zip file to a directory of your choice. This will be the directory where you’ll run Needle.

4. **Run Needle**:
    - Open your terminal application.
    - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you extracted Needle.
    - Run the Needle shell by executing the following command:
      ```bash
      ruby ndle.rb
      ```
    - You should now see the Needle prompt, which will allow you to start entering commands.

Needle is open source and highly customizable. Feel free to modify the code, add new commands, or make any changes to suit your needs!
